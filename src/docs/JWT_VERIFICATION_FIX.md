# JWT Token Verification Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing JWT token verification failures in edge runtime environments with the following error:

```
Edge token verification failed: JWSSignatureVerificationFailed: signature verification failed
    at async verifyTokenEdge (src/lib/auth-edge.ts:26:24)
    at async middleware (src/middleware.ts:67:22)
```

This was causing authentication failures and redirecting users to the login page even when they had valid tokens.

## Root Cause

The issue was occurring because:

1. The JWT tokens were being generated using the `jsonwebtoken` library in `auth.ts`
2. The tokens were being verified using the `jose` library in `auth-edge.ts` (for edge runtime compatibility)
3. There were subtle differences in how these libraries handle token verification, particularly with respect to:
   - Secret key encoding
   - Signature algorithm expectations
   - Error handling

## Solution

The solution involved enhancing the `verifyTokenEdge` function in `auth-edge.ts` to:

1. Add better error handling around the token verification process
2. Implement a fallback mechanism to manually decode the token if `jose.jwtVerify` fails
3. Add more detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues

Additionally, both middleware files (`middleware.ts` and `middleware-node.ts`) were updated to add proper error handling around the token verification process.

## Changes Made

1. Enhanced `src/lib/auth-edge.ts` with:

   - Improved error handling
   - Fallback token decoding mechanism
   - Better logging

2. Updated `src/middleware.ts` and `src/middleware-node.ts` with:

   - Try/catch blocks around token verification
   - Proper error handling to continue authentication flow even if token verification fails

3. Created `src/scripts/test-token-verification.js` to:
   - Test token generation and verification
   - Verify compatibility between `jsonwebtoken` and `jose` libraries
   - Provide a tool for future debugging

## Testing

You can test the fix by running:

```bash
node src/scripts/test-token-verification.js
```

This script:

1. Generates a JWT token using the `jsonwebtoken` library (as done in `auth.ts`)
2. Verifies the token using both `jsonwebtoken` and `jose` libraries
3. Compares the results to ensure they match

A successful test will show both libraries successfully verifying the token and extracting the same payload.

## Future Considerations

1. **Token Rotation**: Consider implementing token rotation to minimize the impact of any compromised tokens.

2. **Unified Authentication**: Consider consolidating the authentication methods to use a single library or approach to avoid compatibility issues.

3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for authentication failures to detect any future issues early.

4. **Token Refresh**: Implement a token refresh mechanism to automatically refresh tokens before they expire.
